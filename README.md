Basic ESP kit for games I play

You can easily add players, objects, and npcs using this basic kit

basic api:

framework:register_player(<player> player)
  
framework:register_humanoid(<table> humanoid) -- Just insert the character model i.e: {model = workspace.NPC}
  
framework:register_object(<table> model) -- You can insert a model or part it doesn't matter, example: framework:register_object({model = Workspace.Objective})
